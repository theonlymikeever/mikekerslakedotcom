My passion lies in the blend of art and technology. Because user experience is everything around us, digital and physical, it's my goal to understand the nuance. To create aesthetically pleasing and intuitive applications requires meticulous technical ability, extensive engagement research and an artistic repertoire.

I absolutely love learning, and Iâ€™ve spent the better part of my life doing so. This is because I am consistently interested in deconstructing problems down to the nuts and bolts to better understand how something works on the inside. Knowing how the sauce is made means I can better engineer solutions or create something entirely new.

I also enjoy a perfect pour over cup of coffee, long podcasts, thought provoking anime and the (endless) search for the best pizza I've ever had.
