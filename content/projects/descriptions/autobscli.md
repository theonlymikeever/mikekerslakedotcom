Simple and terse cli for automated [BrowserStack](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and Webdriver front-end testing.

autoBS wraps around [Nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/), and builds configuration files on the fly. No more hassle in managing complex configuration builds for each environment you need to write front-end testing for. Just enter your BS credentials and start running tests!
