Simple and terse cli for automated [BrowserStack](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and Webdriver front-end testing.

autoBS wraps around [Nightwatch](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/), that builds configuration files on the fly. No more hassle in managing complex configuration builds for each environment. Just enter your BS credentials and start running tests!

Currently in development and soon to be open source.
