mvt.js is a lightweight a/b testing framework and dom manipulation library. This tool allows developers to rapidly create variations for optimization testing that can be injected at runtime. 

- Write tests in a component structure, reducing boilerplate for each variant
- Compatibility with single page applications built on front-end frameworks such as React
- Detects component re-renderers, and adapts variant based DOM changes accordingly
- *Currently in development and soon to be open source*
