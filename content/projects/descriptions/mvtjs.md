mvt.js is a lightweight a/b testing framework and dom manipulation library. This tool allows developers to rapidly create variations for optimization testing that can be injected at runtime. mvt.js features compatibility with single page applications built with frameworks such as React, and thus can rerender variations on the fly.

Currently in development and soon to be open source.
